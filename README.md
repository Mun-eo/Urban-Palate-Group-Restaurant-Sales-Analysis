# Urban Palate Group Restaurant Sales Analysis

<h2>Description</h2>

This project works with a hypothetical UK restaurant company "The Urban Palate Group" a growing chain of casual dining restaurants, with locations in Lisbon, London, Madrid, Berlin, and Paris known for offering modern British cuisine with international twists.

Amira, the head of regional operations of The Urban Palate Group, contacted me with concerns about inconsistent revenue performance across city locations. While the restaurant group has been expanding steadily, their internal reporting lacks the clarity needed to guide decisions on which locations are thriving, which products are performing best, and how sales are evolving over time.

She requested support in cleaning and analyzing recent order data to answer critical business questions such as:
  - Which city is generating the most revenue?
  - Is revenue increasing or decreasing over time?
  - What are the average quantities sold and average revenue per product?
  - Which product is the top-seller by quantity and by revenue?
  - What is the overall average revenue? 

Goals of the Analysis:
  1. Identify top-performing cities for potential expansion
  2.  Spot underperforming locations that may need strategic changes
  3. Optimize their menu by focusing on high-performing products
  4. Share performance metrics in their quarterly business review

<h2>Technical Tools Used</h2>

- Excel

<h2>Understanding the dataset:</h2>
The dataset consisted of 255 order transactions of products purchased per day from each city location(Lisbon, London, Madrid, Berlin, and Paris). This included the quantity, method of payment, and purchase type. This dataset was chosen as it provides the information needed to answer the critical business questions that have been requested to solve. I used Excel to clean, analyze and visualize the data as it allowed me efficiently calculate the revenue specific products were bringing in per day and which location were generating the most revenue.

<h2>Data Cleaning walk-through:</h2>

  1. First, I removed the manager column within the dataset as that column would not be relevant to answer the business questions at hand.
  2. I changed the order date values into a mm-dd-yyyy format(07-20-2022) from a dd-mm-yyyy(20-07-2022) format to see a clear progression of revenue per day
  3. Some products had variety of prices, to find the true price of each product I filtered the dataset by the product and used conditional formatting to highlight outliers in the price column.
  4. Then I used find and replace to replace the outlier values with the common price value in the price column for some of the products.
  5. When attempting to create the revenue column the returned values were not the accurate revenue number from multiplying the price of the product by the quantity number of the order to receive the revenue.
  6. I discovered the issue was with the quantity column. The values had it's decimal points even when itâ€™s removed by the remove decimal points by function on the home page.
  7. To resolve this issue I used the =Round() formula to return the number without its decimal points, ultimately creating the accurate revenue number

This process of data cleaning improved the quality of my analysis by clearing outliers within the dataset, allowing me to create an accurate representation of revenue generated per order transaction. This ultimatly allows me to visualize the data to view the sales trends for The Urban Palate Group.
